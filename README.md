just a proof-of-concept

Some years ago in a news-documentary style short film I saw a little investigation about how or why Youtube videos sometimes have high views although it doesn't make any sense.
The code was not shown back than.

I left the comments to demonstrate other possibilities.

I use chrome that is launched already, and it can run when the computer is 'idle'.
